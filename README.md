A fork of [PuzzleScript by increpare](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript).
Currently, the only change is that this fork allows sprites to be taller than 5
pixels, and will align them at the bottom edge of the cell. This allows you to
create a simple pseudo-3D effect by, e.g. using the bottom three pixels for an
object's front face and then the top five pixels for its top face.
